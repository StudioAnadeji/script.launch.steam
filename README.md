# Launch Steam from Kodi
An incredibly bare-bones Kodi 19.x (Matrix) compatible Addon that launches Steam.

## Usage

Download latest ZIP, install manually. Edit "addon.py" to set path and options. The Addon is currently set to use a Linux path by default, but this can be changed for us in any OS.

## Future

May add UI-based method to change executable path.
